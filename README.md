This repository provides structured lab materials designed to introduce Python programming through incremental, real-world applications. 
Developed for students at the Technical University of Cluj Napoca, it emphasizes practical use of Python’s standard libraries for tasks like file management, data parsing and automation. 

The labs are organized into Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts, enabling learners to transition from syntax basics to solving industry-aligned problems. 
The content focuses on core programming concepts such as control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP), integrated with exercises simulating real-life scenarios. 
Examples include log file handling, directory cleanup automation, along with JSON data processing - leveraging libraries like os, json, and pathlib. 
While no formal releases are published, the repository’s public accessibility allows students to clone or fork it freely.

To use these materials, clone the repository and explore the notebooks using Google Colab or a compatible IDE. Contributions are welcome via pull requests, provided they align with the course's curriculum goals. 
Maintained by INTERTECHNICA BUSINESS SOLUTIONS / Marin Iuga, this repository serves as a foundational resource for Python education, prioritizing hands-on practice over theoretical exposition.
