1. Considering the following electricity bill calculation rules:

UNIT                PRICE
First 100 units     5.0  EUR per unit
Next 100 units      7.5  EUR per unit
After 200 units     10.0 EUR per unit

Please calculate the price of 500 electricity units.

2. We need to perform payment processing and we need to scrutinize very large payment amounts. Considering a list of payments to be done, we need create two lists:

    If a payment is below or equal to a certain value it will be added to the standard payments list;
    If a payment is above a certain value it will be added to the large payments list.

Please implement this requirement for a list of your choice, considering that standard payments are all payments that are below the three quarters of the maximum value 
of all payments in the list.

3. We need to implement a quality monitoring mechanism that will detect if the total quantity of impurities in a batch of product samples exceeds a certain limit.
Please implement the following:

    a) Simulate a product sample using a dictionary using two keys "product_mass" and "impurity_mass" which are float values;
    b) Simulate a product batch of 100 products with various product_mass and impurity_mass values. The product_mass is between 50 and 100 and the impurity_mass is between 
    5 and 15. Impurity mass cannot be more than 20% for each sample;
    c) Create a function that explores the product batch in index order and stop as soon as the total weight of impurities at the current index exceeds 10% of the total mass of the products. 
    If such condition is detected, return the index otherwise return -1. Return as well the total mass of products and total mass of impurities calculated so far (use a dictionary for this). 

To simulate random numbers you can use:

=====================
import random
x = random.random()
=====================
 
The random function return a value between 0 and 1.
